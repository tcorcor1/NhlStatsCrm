### Summary

The purpose of this project is to take all players and stats from the NHL REST endpoint and load into Dynamics 365 on a daily basis.

There are scheduled Azure functions that will run overnight and upsert players/stats using the NHL API's id's as an alternate/foreign key.

The API supports some GET requests although this API isn't intended for use by end-users since data should be observed in Dynamics 365.
