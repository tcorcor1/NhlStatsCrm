### Summary

The purpose of this project is to take all players and stats from the NHL REST endpoint and load into Dynamics 365 on a daily basis.

There are scheduled Azure functions that will run overnight and upsert players/stats using the NHL API's id's as an alternate/foreign key.

The API supports some GET requests although this API isn't intended for use by end-users since data should be observed in Dynamics 365.

### Local Development

If you haven't already, I highly recommend joining the Microsoft Developer Program. You will receive your own Microsoft 365 tenant which will include a Dynamics instance among many other things. So long as you continue to use this environment for development, your license will be renewed each 90 days. Check out sign-up info [HERE](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/dev-program).

Initial project setup

- Create your appsettings.Production.json and appsettings.Development.json files. There is an example appsettings.json in the project
- Set up Azure app registration
- Create app role NhlStatsCrm.Contributor and assign to app user
- Replace values in AzureAd prop of appsettings with those from app registration
- Create your Dataverse connection string replacing default values below
- Recommend using Azure Key Vault as mechanism for passing secrets to your App Service / Function app
- Install Dynamics solution [HERE](./docs/solutions).
